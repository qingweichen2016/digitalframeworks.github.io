This dataset discusses about the relationship between Brain weight and body weight of animals and I run the linear regression for this data. R^2 value equal to 0.8726, based on your standard, this value is higher than 0.8 so that it can be seen as success forecast. However, as we can see that there are still several points staying far away from the R^2 value. 

Sometimes when the regression doesn’t fully explain the dataset, there might be 2 reasons causes this happen. One is that there are several wrong data were picked during the process. Wrong data may have large difference with major part of data. Another reason is that there is originally no relationship among two variables. So I may call this “wrong” data outliers. 



## Homework

Email one piece of data journalism to discuss in class next week.
