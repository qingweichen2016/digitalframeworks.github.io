I scrape the US News Best colleges ranking data. After filtering, the spreadsheet can tell the name of top 23 but total 26 universities, their ranking numbers, tuition fees and yearly undergrad enrollment number.

Based on my observation, most the greatest universities have $42,000 to $49,000 as their tuition fees. Three of them have their tuition higher than $50,000 and two of them have tuition lower than $40,000. These two universities are UC-Berkeley and UCLA. And they have the largest number of undergrad enrollment each year which are 27,126 and 29,633. So it might mean that tuition is one of the important factors that students and parents will consider during process they select the right universities.

But the enrollment number does not only be affected by the tuition fee, it may affect by other factors like the school size, location, majors, university cultures and so on. But in general, most of these universities have less than 10,000 undergrad enrollment on each year.
